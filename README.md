# ForSight
Annie and I are in an Architecture and CS class that recently introduced a unit on color theory and colorblindness in lecture. One day after lecture, a conversation with our professor Donald Greenberg left us thinking about how many modern digital design environments donâ€™t emphasize the importance of inclusive design, especially to the visually impaired community.

To ensure the inclusion of many important, yet often overlooked tenants of accessible design, we decided to build a web app that serves a both an educational tool and a practical design assistant. The upcoming semesterly hackathon at Cornell, BigRed//Hacks, provided the perfect opportunity for us to further explore this idea.
